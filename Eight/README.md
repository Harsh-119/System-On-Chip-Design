# Programming an SoC using C Language

Previously, assembly language was used to program the SoC at low-level, which gave better control over the hardware and helped to understand the hardware mechanism at the register transfer level (RTL).
C language will be used to program the SoC at a higher level, whereby compilers, software libraries, and tools can be used to hide the complexity of low-level management. This means that more complicated applications can be created more efficiently.
