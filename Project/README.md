# Arithmetic Game

Mathematics is a fundamental aspect which is used everywhere. Ranging from its use in day-to-day life to complex science. The knowledge of math is required for many applications in the current era, ranging from finance to research.  Mental math has been proven to improve focus and concentration and possibly prevent dementia. This project aims to make a fundamental skill, fun and engaging. This game will create a sense of urgency and give a feeling of accomplishment when the user solves an arithmetic problem. The live score and LED features provide physical stimuli which keep the user engaged. 

This project aims to understand the important concepts related to FPGA and SoC. By utilizing buses and protocols that are used in the industry and also developing C and Assembly Coding skills. The FPGA that is used for this project is a Nexys-A7-100T. Protocols such as UART for serial communication, Timers for time-critical operations and synchronization, VGA for the visual interface, and interrupts are used.
